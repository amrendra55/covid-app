# Project Overview

Deployed on https://covid-19-tracker-cfa43.web.app/. This project falls under the category of Web Development. This project demonstrates the use of Firebase as **BaaS or 'Backend as a Service'**. Data is sourced from various places and is displayed in the form of a heatmap. The heatmap resizes/intensifies depending on the concentration of data. User can select his/her region to comb out specific info from the heatmap.

# Something to Ponder

-useeffects and usestates are use to provide the dynamic effect to the web site.<br>
-the app fetches the Covid data from an api using use effect.<br>
-A map is incorporated in the application to provide the real time view of all the Covid cases around the world.<br>
-Map is build using the react library react-leaflet. React-leaflet provides a map container which can be used to built a map inside our   application.<br>
-The website is deployed using Firebase by using Firebase hosting feature.<br>
-The api used for fetching the data of coronavirus is https://disease.sh/v3/covid-19/all.<br>
-The data is in the form of a string. This is converted to json for using.<br>
-the data collected from API is used to dynamically change the state of Covid cases, country information and the data on map using use state.<br>

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
